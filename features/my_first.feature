Feature: Running a test
  As an iOS developer
  I want to have a sample feature file
  So I can begin testing quickly

Scenario: Example steps
  Given I am on the Welcome Screen
  When I touch the "1" button
  And I touch the "+" button
  And I touch the "2" button
  And I touch the "Enter" button
  Then I see the text "3.0"
